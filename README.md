# Introduction
This maze game is inspired by the pathfinder puzzle game in Honkai Star Rail. This
 small game is so fun that we want to create a separate mini-game in our style.
 
 Maze games have been popular for a long time, starting from simple paper puzzles to
 the digital versions we play today. These games challenge players to move through maze-like
 structures to reach a goal while overcoming obstacles. For example, "Maze War" and
 "Pac-Man," which introduced basic graphics and simple gameplay mechanics. Nowadays,
 maze games come in various forms, from mobile apps to virtual reality experiences, offering
 different challenges and experiences for players, many of the maze-solving games include
 puzzles, strategy, and story elements to make the gameplay more engaging.
 
 Overall, maze games are fun and challenging. They provide a mix of exploration,
 problem-solving, and strategy, making them enjoyable for players of all ages.
